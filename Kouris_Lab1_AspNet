            <p>ASP.NET is a open source framework designed by Microsoft for the development of web applications. It is also widely compatible with web browsers and mobile platforms. <br>
                  ASP.NET allows for server side generation of dynamic web apps that can use client side software to update and allow for user interaction
            </p>

        <h2 class="header" id="forms">ASP.NET Forms</h2>
            <p>ASP.NET Forms (Forms) are one of four models within the ASP infrastructure. It is a drag and drop control platform that allows for easy layout of webpages.<br>
                  Forms are user requested pages that are compiled on the server and the framework helps to generate the HTML markup.<br>
                  This makes the framework very quick and flexible.

            <p>Forms were the main basis for the framework before the introduction of MVC. Forms are also not suported by ASP.NET Core. Dynamic code is often written in code-behind format where files are kept separate based on language used.<br>
            This allows the developers to make adjustments much faster and easier than if it weren't compartmentalized.</p>
